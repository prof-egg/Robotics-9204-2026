## Week 1 - 2026-01-12 (CURRENT)
This week we are just going to try and figure out how exactly things will work for this season. By the end of the week hopefully we will feel comfortable actually getting started on programming.

### General
- New smaller GroupMe for team programmers?
- Figure out who is on the programming roster this season
  - Originally, it seemed that nolan was interested in being on the programming team but he may have backed out, and we might get some more members
- Figure out programming situation
  - There is only one device that the team has that we can currently program on, that is obviously not enough
  - Our choices seem to be to either get the bigwigs at PCHS HQ to let us use the CAD Lab computers, or use some of the spare robotics laptops
- Figure out what we are even going to program
  - The engineers seemed on the edge on whether we were doing tank drive again, taking a shot at swerve drive, or doing both
- Go over [command-based programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html) for FRC robotics

### Git/GitHub
- Go over the basics of Git and GitHub
- Cover information about this repo
- Create GitHub accounts and add team to this private repo
- Team members successfully cloned the repo
- "Who was here?" github excersize
