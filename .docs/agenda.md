# Agenda
The agenda will hold general information about what we are maybe supposed to be doing for the week as the programming team. 

## Week 6 - 2026-02-16
Test the robot?

## [Week 3 - 2026-01-26](https://github.com/prof-egg/Robotics-9204-2026)
Last week we went over basic git and github practices (or at least half of us did), this week we are getting into programming fr fr.
### General
- Research basic tank drive
- Program basic tank drive
  - We are each going to each make our own branch and title it according to [naming convetions](naming-conventions.md). For example: `feature/mik-tank-drive`.
  - We are all going to try to get comfortable with the [command-based](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html) programming framework and by programming your own tank-drive software in your own branch.
  - Hopefully we will have time to see how we can deploy our code to the ROBORio and debug if we need to.
- Our focus this year is swerve drive, but programming tank drive first will be good practice and gives us an easy drivetrain to test other robot modules on.

## Week 2 - 2026-01-19
Last week was crazy because we didn't actually do anything, the goal this week: do something
### General
- Speedrun week 1 stuff
- Try to program basic tank drive on the old robot chassis
  - What does command-based programming look like?
  - What does interacting with the robot through WPILib actually look like? (interact with motors, get controller input, etc.)
  - How do we deploy our code to the robot? (I actually don't know so we gotta figure this one out)
  - How can we test code without needing to deploy? (something to think about but I think we will have to answer this some other time)

## Week 1 - 2026-01-12
This week we are just going to try and figure out how exactly things will work for this season. By the end of the week hopefully we will feel comfortable actually getting started on programming.

### General
- New smaller GroupMe for team programmers?
- Figure out who is on the programming roster this season
  - Originally, it seemed that nolan was interested in being on the programming team but he may have backed out, and we might get some more members
- Figure out programming situation
  - There is only one device that the team has that we can currently program on, that is obviously not enough
  - Our choices seem to be to either get the bigwigs at PCHS HQ to let us use the CAD Lab computers, or use some of the spare robotics laptops
- Figure out what we are even going to program
  - The engineers seemed on the edge on whether we were doing tank drive again, taking a shot at swerve drive, or doing both
- Go over [command-based programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html) for FRC robotics

### Git/GitHub
- Go over the basics of Git and GitHub
- Cover information about this repo
- Create GitHub accounts and add team to this private repo
- Team members successfully cloned the repo
- "Who was here?" github excersize
