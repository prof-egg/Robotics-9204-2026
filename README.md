# FRC 2026
This repo stores the code for team 9204's 2026 competition robot as well as convenient team programming resources in [.docs](.docs/). 

Changes will be documented [here](CHANGELOG.md) (hopefully) to help with development and to leave as a good resource for future seasons.

## For this Year's Programmers
Welcome to the 2026 repo! Git and GitHub is probably new to you so I've included some information below.
TLDR is that git/github is an amazing tool that real-world programmers use for colloboration and organizing code with related resources, so I wanted to see if it would work out for us.
